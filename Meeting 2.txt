Discussion:

Research paper 1 (Deep-COVID Predicting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using deep transfer learning)
Research paper 2 (COVID-19 Deep Learning Prediction Model Using PubliclyAvailable Radiologist-Adjudicated Chest X-Ray Images asTraining Data: Preliminary Findings)

Models in the paper
ResNet18
ResNet50
SqueezeNet
DenseNet-121
Model Implementation(Pytorch)
Dataset (https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)
Code (https://github.com/shervinmin/DeepCovid.git)


Suggestions/Recommendations:

pytorch 
tensorflow
understanding cnn
deep learning
transfer learning
conventional machine learning
deep learing MIT courses
references of these all
note taking

Next Tasks Assigned:

model should be ready in next meeting
code should run on kaggle or colab
limitations of this work
synchronize colab with github
