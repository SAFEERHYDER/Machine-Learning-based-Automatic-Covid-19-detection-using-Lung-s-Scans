# This is my Final Year Project

## [ FreeCourseWeb.com ] Datascience - COVID-19 Pneumonia Classification (Deep learning)
[Udemy Crourse](https://www.udemy.com/course/datasciencecovid-19-pneumonia-classificationdeep-learning/)
A Practical Hands-on Data Science Guided Project on Covid-19 Pneumonia Classification through X-rays using Deep Learning.

**This is a hands-on Data Science guided project on Covid-19 Pneumonia Classification. No unnecessary lectures.**

**"Short, sweet, to the point course"**

The same techniques can be used in :

**Skin cancer detection**
**Normal pneumonia detection**
**Brain defect analysis**
**Retinal Image Analysis**



And any other diseases that use image-based reporting, like X-ray reports.

This Course is About:


**How to detect Coronavirus infection using the Xray Report of the lungs of Patients**
**Classify COVID 19 based on x-ray images using deep learning**
**Learn to Build and train a Convolutional neural network**
**Make a prediction on new data using CNN Model**



Task 1: Getting Introduced to Google Colab Environment & importing necessary libraries
Task 2: Importing, Cloning & Exploring Dataset
Task 3: Data visualization (Image Visualization)
Task 4: Data augmentation & Normalization
Task 5: Building Convolutional neural network model
Task 6: Compiling & Training CNN Model
Task 7: Performance evaluation & Testing the model & saving the model for future use
